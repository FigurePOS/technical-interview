1. To run the application you need to install the dependencies using your favorite package manager (e.g. yarn or npm).
2. In order to check your code compiles and to see the result it produces on test data use command 'yarn start' (or npm start).
3. You can discuss adding any additional libraries you would like to use for the implementation with the examiner.
4. You are encouraged to test your solution and split the implementation to small testable units according to your preference.
